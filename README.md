Dark Souls 3 CE Patch Project

Any new ideas should be posted as issues, all suggestions are welcome.
This is an open project, and all help with writing scripts for the patch changes is appreciated.
Join The Grand Archives for discussion: https://discord.gg/NmKfgwt

Proposed changes can be found under the Projects tab

When adding new scripts that you made, please credit yourself in the script so your name (real name or online alias) can be put into the credits. (It's fine if you don't want to though)
